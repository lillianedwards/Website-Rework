# Horiseon-Website-Rework

#Description

Horiseon Marketing Agency wanted their site in-line with accesibility standards so their agency is optimized on search engines. Along the way to increasing their standing in search engine results, I also took the opputinity to clean up some of the exisiting code for their homepage.

Here are the major improvements:

âœ… HTML div's were replaced with semantic elements that    make it easier to read.
âœ… HTML was logically scructured to include sections and an aside. 
âœ… Styling was condensed to shorten the length while still leaving the same aesthetic for the agency. 
And of course...
âœ… Alt attributes were added to the image elements. 

Keeping the code clean and concise is crucial for future maintenance and builds on the site as Horiseon continues to grow. Additionally, the alt attributes will make sure Horiseon's search engine optimization will rise and users with screen readers and other reading challenges can positively access their site.  ðŸŽ‰
